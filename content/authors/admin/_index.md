I am a Ph.D. student in Public Policy in the joint program between Georgia State University and Georgia Institute of Technology (job market expected in 2023-2024), working under the advisement of Dr. Ross Rubenstein, Dan E. Sweat Distinguished Chair in Educational and Community Policy. My current research interests revolve around program evaluation, human capital development, STEM education, and tackling upward mobility questions through social innovation, such as social capital and social entrepreneurship. Building on these topics, I investigate how educational outcomes differ for the traditionally disadvantaged or low-income groups and the ways to boost social opportunities through human capital development.

I have been graciously funded by the *Coca-Cola Foundation* with the additional stipend to attend the program through Dean's Fellowship. I have recently been selected as the 2022 APPAM Entrepreneurship Policy Student Fellowship cohort with generous honoraria from the *Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation* for my research on tackling social inequity through Social Entrepreneurship. I have just completed a Causal Inference for Social Impact Lab’s Data Challenge hosted by the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University. I have been researching as a lead author of the paper on the effect of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education in boosting opportunities for the traditionally under-represented groups of women, blacks, and Hispanics, as a part of the Research on Careers in Science (ROCS) Lab at Georgia Tech graciously funded by the *Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation*.

I hold a Master's in Public Policy from the KDI School of Public Policy and Management, where I graduated as both the Valedictorian and Salutatorian of my class (*ask me how!*). Before joining the doctoral program, I worked as a Senior Research Associate at KDI (Korea Development Institute), receiving the Best Employee Award for three consecutive years. The South Korean Government selected my paper with my colleagues on the regulatory sandbox at local levels as the Best Paper of the Year in 2020. I graduated summa cum laude with Honors from Rhodes College with a degree in Economics and International Relations, with an induction to highly selective academic honor societies, including Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron Delta Kappa.

I am currently teaching PMAP 3311 Critical Policy Issues, a writing-intensive course introducing the foundations of public policy to upper-level students of undergraduate students. Outside the classroom and research environment, I strive to spread kindness: my colleagues have awarded me the Miss Sunshine award for bringing a smile to everyone I encounter. My ultimate goal is to become a channel for benevolent influence by providing a daily dose of sunshine in people's lives through my research and kindness.
