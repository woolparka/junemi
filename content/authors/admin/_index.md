Hi there, I am a Ph.D. candidate in Public Policy in a joint program between Georgia Institute of Technology, and Georgia State University (currently in the job market as of 2024). I am working under the advisement of Dr. Ross Rubenstein, Dan E. Sweat Distinguished Chair in Educational and Community Policy. 

My primary research interests revolve around program evaluation, human capital development, higher education, and tackling upward mobility questions through social innovation, such as social capital and social entrepreneurship. Building on these topics, I investigate how educational outcomes differ for the traditionally disadvantaged or low-income groups and the ways to boost social opportunities through human capital development. I work on a lot of quantitative projects focusing on quasi-experiments, and systematic review and meta-analysis. Please refer to my CV below for more details on my research focus!

A little more background about myeself - before joining the doctoral program, I worked as a Senior Research Associate at KDI (Korea Development Institute), a highly regarded think tank in Korea. I recieved multiple accolades during my time there such as the 2020 best paper of the year awarded by the South Korean Government. Prior to that I attended the KDI School of Public Policy and Management for the Master's in Public Policy.

Outside of research, teaching holds a special palce in my heart. During my doctorate program I have taught (*Critical Policy Issues (PMAP 3311)*), a writing-intensive course introducing the foundations of public policy to upper-level students of undergraduate students. 

Overall, I strive to spread kindness which is reflected in my research interests, and my teaching philosophy. My ultimate goal is to become a channel for benevolent influence by contributing to research in critical areas to improve equity for those in need.
